# Introduction
X-ray fluorescent spectrometry (XRF) has been a cornerstone technique in archaeological science for many years. Its applications have ranged from identifying the elemental composition of artifacts to sourcing raw materials and understanding ancient manufacturing processes. However, XRF's potential for developing specific geochemical signatures within large archaeological databases remains largely untapped. This study seeks to bridge this gap by demonstrating a novel methodology using machine learning algorithms and statistical insights on data derived from XRF to create comparative geochemical signatures within a localized archaeological database.

Using thousands of geochemical samples collected from the Ness of Brodgar archaeological site, this project analyzes a comprehensive spectral database that allows for site-specific internal comparisons. Unlike traditional approaches that provide universally quantifiable data in parts per million (ppm), this study emphasizes relative comparison within the site-specific context. By employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we transform complex spectral data into simplified, distinctive signatures that are easy to compare across the larger dataset.

The innovative methodology presented in this project provides a new level of geochemical comparative data, enabling archaeological researchers to make more informed interpretations about site-specific patterns and relationships. This localized approach, while not offering universally quantifiable results, significantly enhances the ability to compare samples within the greater collection of data from the Ness of Brodgar, opening new avenues for archaeological research and analysis. The tools derived from this project will help researchers provide scientific foundations for future publications and interpretations by integrating their own studies with the relevant geochemical data from the site.
