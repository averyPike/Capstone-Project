# Conclusions
The innovative methodology developed in this study offers a valuable tool for archaeological specialists aiming to uncover relationships between geochemical data and other forms of archaeological evidence. By employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the complexity of geochemical signatures, researchers can now compare simplified, distinctive signatures across different contexts within the site. This approach provides a new level of geochemical comparative data, enabling more informed interpretations of site-specific patterns and relationships. While this study focuses on the Ness of Brodgar, the methodologies and tools developed here serve as a blueprint for similar projects. Other archaeological sites with extensive geochemical data can benefit from the PCA approach to gain insights into their data. The ability to identify which elements contribute most significantly to the variance in geochemical data allows for targeted analysis and more nuanced interpretations, aiding in understanding trade patterns, site formation processes, and human activities.

The study's success in using PCA to analyze the Ness of Brodgar's geochemical data highlights its potential for broader applications. By transforming complex spectral data into accessible and interpretable signatures, researchers can more easily compare samples and identify significant geochemical patterns. This localized comparative approach enhances the interpretative potential of geochemical data, providing a robust framework for future archaeological research using data from the site. The primary limitation of the project is that the study's approach is tailored to the specific site conditions at the Ness of Brodgar caused by a lack of known geochemical standards. While the methodology can serve as a blueprint, any given archaeological site will present unique challenges and geochemical characteristics that require adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability to integrate geochemical data with other archaeological evidence opens new avenues for detailed and contextually relevant interpretations. The insights produced from data analysis in this project are valid, but must be acknowledged as site specific. 

In conclusion, the methodology presented in this project successfully demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques, specifically PCA, in transforming complex geochemical data into simplified signatures that are easy to compare across larger datasets. This approach enhances the ability to interpret site-specific patterns and relationships, ultimately contributing to the advancement of archaeological science. The tools derived from this project will help researchers provide scientific foundations for future publications and interpretations by integrating their own studies with relevant geochemical data from the site.
